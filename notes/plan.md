Why parsing & execution is a natural split

    Parsing:

        Reads the raw input string.

        Handles quotes, escapes, variable expansion, syntax errors, redirections, pipes.

        Produces a structured representation (often a linked list or tree of commands with arguments, redirections, etc.).

    Execution:

        Takes the structured representation and actually runs the commands, handling fork(), execve(), redirections, pipes, environment variables, builtins, etc.

This is a clean separation of responsibilities: parsing doesn’t need to know about fork(), and execution doesn’t need to care about how spaces inside quotes are parsed.
Potential problem with a hard split

If you split into “you do parsing” and “I do execution” without overlap:

    The execution person might get blocked waiting for the parser to be complete.

    The parser person might not know what structure is easiest for execution, leading to mismatches.

    Debugging “is this a parsing bug or an execution bug?” can turn into a blame tennis match. 🎾

Better way to split work

Instead of a rigid split, I’d suggest collaborating on the interface first:

    Agree on the internal data structure that the parser will output and the executor will consume.

        Example: A t_cmd struct with argv[], input_redirect, output_redirect, is_builtin, etc.

        Decide whether you’ll store pipes and redirections inside one struct or as separate nodes.

    Build a minimal vertical slice together:

        Start with simple commands (no quotes, no pipes, no redirections).

        Parse them into your agreed struct.

        Execute them with fork() + execve().

    Once the slice works, split into:

        Parser enhancements: quotes, $VAR expansion, >/</>>/<<, syntax errors.

        Executor enhancements: builtins, multiple pipes, heredocs, signal handling, error codes.

This way:

    You both understand the whole codebase.

    You can develop in parallel after the initial base is ready.

    You avoid a big painful merge where parser output doesn’t match executor expectations.

💡 Extra tip:
Even if you split later, make sure both of you can debug both parts — in Minishell, parsing bugs often look like execution bugs and vice versa.

If you want, I can outline a suggested first-week plan for a two-person Minishell team so you can avoid bottlenecks and get to a working prototype faster. That would make the split a lot smoother.

Alright — here’s a first-week Minishell plan for a two-person team that avoids the “I’m blocked waiting on you” problem and sets you up for a smooth split later.
📅 Week 1 — Two-Person Minishell Kickstart Plan
Day 1 – Kickoff & Ground Rules

    Decide together:

        Norminette style rules you’ll follow strictly.

        Variable/function naming convention (consistent across parser & executor).

        Git workflow (branching, merging, code review rules).

        How you’ll store environment variables internally (linked list vs array).

    Create a barebones repo with:

        main.c that loops with readline() + add_history().

        A Makefile that compiles cleanly with -Wall -Wextra -Werror.

Day 2 – Agree on Internal Data Structure

    Work together to define the command node struct that the parser will output and the executor will consume.
    Example:
```C
    typedef struct s_cmd
    {
        char **argv;
        char *infile;
        char *outfile;
        int append;
        int pipe_to_next;
        struct s_cmd *next;
    } t_cmd;
```
    Decide what info is stored here and how heredocs will be represented.

    Add a dummy parser that returns a hardcoded t_cmd list for testing.

Day 3 – Minimal Execution Prototype

    Both work together on a simple execution path:

        No quotes, no redirections, no pipes.

        Parse space-separated tokens into argv[].

        fork() + execve() works for /bin/ls and friends.

        Handle absolute & relative paths.

    Add a very simple builtin like exit.

Day 4 – Vertical Slice with One Redirection

    Parser person:

        Parse a single > output redirection into the struct.

    Executor person:

        Handle opening that file with O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC and redirecting stdout before execve().

    By the end of the day: ls > file.txt works.

Day 5 – Pipes

    Parser person:

        Split commands on | and chain them with pipe_to_next = 1.

    Executor person:

        Implement pipe creation & dup2() redirection.

    Test: ls | grep .c works.

Day 6 – Builtin Skeleton

    Agree on which builtins you’ll implement (cd, echo, env, exit, export, pwd, unset).

    Executor person:

        Implement them without parsing complexity.

    Parser person:

        Add is_builtin flag to struct.

    Test: cd and pwd work.

Day 7 – Expansion & Quotes

    Parser person:

        Start implementing $VAR and $? expansion.

        Add basic quote handling (keep quoted strings as one token).

    Executor person:

        Improve error handling (command not found, permission denied).

        Implement exit status propagation.

✅ End of Week Goal:
You have a working shell that:

    Reads commands from readline.

    Runs external programs via execve.

    Handles one redirection, pipes, and at least 2 builtins.

    Has an agreed-upon parser → executor interface.

    Can be extended in parallel without blocking each other.

If you want, I can also give you a Week 2–3 roadmap that continues the split and covers heredocs, full redirection support, signal handling, and memory cleanup — that’s where most teams get stuck. That plan would basically take you from prototype to norm-ready.
